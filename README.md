# chengfeng-videocut-subtitle

Rebuild reviewed subtitles from a transcript and cut ledger.

Generate and validate subtitle candidates, preserve reviewed changes and submit through a compatible workbench. Standalone candidate scripts are included.

中文：用已有逐词稿与账本生成、校对和排版字幕。 独立 Skill 文件包，不包含 Runtime、Studio、FFmpeg 或渲染浏览器。

## Quick Start

Unpublished local candidate **0.1.0-beta.2**. Run in this verified source checkout with Node.js 18+. No GitHub tag or remote installation of this candidate is claimed; use an empty isolated target first. These commands install Skill files only; they do not install or start a workbench. Review the package before executing it.

```sh
node bin/install.cjs plan --host codex --target-root "<existing-test-directory>"
node bin/install.cjs install --host codex --target-root "<existing-test-directory>"
node bin/install.cjs doctor --host codex --target-root "<existing-test-directory>"
```

The default target is your user home. For an isolated test, create an empty directory first and include `--target-root "<existing-test-directory>"` in all three commands. Omit `--host codex` to install only the neutral Agent directory. For published versions, use the documented version tag and verify its commit plus the installed file hashes. On npm 10.9.2, the shorthand with a full 40-character commit instead of the tag failed with `GitFetcher requires an Arborist constructor`; do not assume that form works on every npm version.

Files go to `.agents/skills/chengfeng-videocut-subtitle` under the target home; Codex mode also creates a precise `.codex/skills/chengfeng-videocut-subtitle` entry. Matching ID, version and file hashes are reused. A conflicting name, version or locally modified copy is rejected without overwriting it. The local receipt does not yet store repository commit, suite ownership or Runtime compatibility. No automatic upgrade or uninstall is provided.

Published preview identities are listed in [the product installation guide](https://github.com/Agentchengfeng/chengfeng-videocut/blob/main/INSTALL.md#verified-preview-commits). That table records verified tag-to-commit mappings, not a signed release or a compatible full-suite manifest. Local candidates are not covered by those published identities.

## Use with an Agent

Once your host discovers the Skill, ask it to use `$chengfeng-videocut-subtitle` for your task. The actual method is [SKILL.md](.agents/skills/chengfeng-videocut-subtitle/SKILL.md); the root SKILL.md is an installer entry, not a duplicate business method. A new host session may be needed. Installing files is not proof that a host has loaded them.

For project operations, this Skill uses [the workbench contract](.agents/skills/chengfeng-videocut-subtitle/references/shared/plugin-access.md) and probes actual CLI capabilities. Runtime >=0.5.9 alone does not guarantee every command; use a compatible workbench and an explicit project/endpoint. Other workbenches require their own verified adapter. Missing software is not silently downloaded.


## Preview limits

- File installation, host loading, Runtime compatibility and a completed video workflow are separate checks.
- `doctor` reports `runtime: not-checked` and `hostLoaded: not-checked`; these fields are not a claim of readiness.
- Windows and real host/business end-to-end validation are not claimed by this source preview.
- No cloud transcription, account access, telemetry, media upload or automatic Issue submission runs during installation.
- Source previews do not publish an entire workbench release or promise a one-command full suite.

## Package maintenance

The canonical method lives at `.agents/skills/chengfeng-videocut-subtitle/`. Shared contracts and installer/audit helpers are generated snapshots from the workbench, with provenance where applicable. See [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md) for upload boundaries. In a source checkout run `npm run check:package` and `npm run check:upload` before a release. Tests of file boundaries do not replace manual content/license review.

This repository is intentionally `private: true` in package.json to prevent accidental npm-registry publication. GitHub installation and `npm pack --ignore-scripts` are still supported. For changes, open a focused Issue or pull request with a minimal reproducible example; never attach secrets or private media.
